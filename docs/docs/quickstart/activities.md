# Creating an activity

Activities can have side-effects and don't have to be deterministic. They will be executed only once and the result is persisted:

```go
func Activity1(ctx context.Context, a, b int) (int, error) {
	return a + b, nil
}

func Activity2(ctx context.Context) (int, error) {
	return 12, nil
}

```
